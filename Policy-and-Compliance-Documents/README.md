# Policies & Compliance Documents

**Purpose (GRC):** Map **policies** to **control validation** already in the repo; prove they are testable and enforced.

## Controls validated by my labs
- **Access Control (AC):** AD Enumeration → `Technical-Labs/Active-Directory-Enumeration/`
- **Network Security (NS):** Firewall Automation → `Technical-Labs/Firewall-Rule-Automation/`
- **Threat Protection (TP):** DNS Blocking → `Technical-Labs/DNS-Blocking-Automation/`
- **Application Security (AS):** SQLi & Directory Traversal → `Technical-Labs/SQLMap-Enumeration/`, `Technical-Labs/Directory-Traversal/`
- **Monitoring (MON):** Packet capture findings → `Technical-Labs/Wireshark-Sniffing-Network-Traffic/`

> Next: add short policy stubs (AC, NS, TP, IR, VM) with control tests and link to the lab evidence above.
