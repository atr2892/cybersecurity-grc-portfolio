# Active Directory Enumeration

## Overview
Case study lab demonstrating technical security skills that directly support GRC processes by identifying IAM misconfigurations and privilege escalation paths.

## Tools
- PowerView
- BloodHound
- Windows Server (lab environment)

## Approach
- **Problem:** Identity & access misconfigurations create audit and security risk.
- **Action:** Enumerated AD objects using PowerView, analyzed escalation paths with BloodHound, and documented findings.
- **Result:** Prioritized findings and created an audit-ready remediation guide.

## GRC Relevance
- Maps to **NIST AC-2 (Account Management)** and **ISO 27001 A.9 (Access Control)**.
- Provides evidence for **SOC 2 - Logical Access Controls**.
- Supports internal audit with reproducible enumeration methodology and documented escalation paths.

## Artifacts
- 📁 **src/** — PowerView scripts and collection helpers
- 📁 **evidence/** — BloodHound outputs and screenshots
- 📁 **docs/** — remediation guide and prioritized action items
