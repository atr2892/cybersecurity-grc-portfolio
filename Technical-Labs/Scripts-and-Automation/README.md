## Overview
Collection of small automation tools used across labs (reporting, feed ingestion, remediation helpers).

## Objective
Standardize automation utilities that support lab reproducibility and evidence collection.

## Tools & Methods
- **Tools/Scripts:** Bash, Python
- **Techniques:** Idempotent scripts, logging, scheduled runs

## Approach
- **Problem:** Repetitive manual tasks increase error and slow evidence production.
- **Action:** Created reusable scripts with logging and safe rollbacks.
- **Result:** Faster reproducible runs and consistent artifacts.

## GRC Relevance
- Demonstrates process and operational control automation for evidence and audit.

## Artifacts
- 📁 **src/** — scripts
- 📁 **docs/** — runbook and usage notes
