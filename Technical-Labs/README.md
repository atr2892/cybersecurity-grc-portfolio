# Technical Labs (Supporting Evidence)

These labs show the technical work that validates control decisions. They are intended as supporting evidence for the GRC projects.

Common files in each lab:
- lab-notes.md  (what I did, why it matters)
- screenshots/  (evidence for findings)
- scripts/      (automation used)
- raw-output/   (pcap, nmap output, logs)

Example subfolders:
- Cloud-Administration
- Network-Administration
- Scripts-and-Automation
- Screenshots
