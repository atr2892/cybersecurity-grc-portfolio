# ðŸ”’ Technical Labs â€” Control Validation, Risk Analysis & Security Automation
These labs demonstrate my ability to **identify risks**, **validate/enforce controls**, and **automate remediation** in alignment with GRC frameworks (NIST CSF, CIS Controls, ISO 27001). Each lab includes scripts, evidence, and concise documentation designed for quick recruiter review.

## How to Navigate
- `src/` â€“ scripts, configs, artifacts (pcap, bash, ps1, py)
- `evidence/` â€“ redacted screenshots/outputs proving the result
- `docs/` â€“ short write-ups linking findings to risk/control value

## Lab Index (with one-line impact)
- **Active Directory Enumeration** â€” Implements access discovery to identify privilege exposure and support IAM risk reduction.  
  `Technical-Labs/Active-Directory-Enumeration/`
- **DNS Blocking Automation** â€” Automates malicious domain blocking to prevent callbacks and reduce threat exposure.  
  `Technical-Labs/DNS-Blocking-Automation/`
- **Firewall Rule Automation** â€” Transforms threat intel into enforced network controls to harden perimeter defenses.  
  `Technical-Labs/Firewall-Rule-Automation/`
- **Malware Removal Automation** â€” Uses automated detection and cleanup to limit malware persistence and reduce dwell time.  
  `Technical-Labs/Malware-Removal-Automation/`
- **Network Traffic Analysis (Wireshark/tcpdump)** â€” Validates data-in-transit risks by identifying insecure protocols and exposed credentials.  
  `Technical-Labs/Wireshark-Sniffing-Network-Traffic/`
- **Nmap Recon & Bash Automation** â€” Performs automated asset/service discovery to surface unmanaged risk and misconfigurations.
