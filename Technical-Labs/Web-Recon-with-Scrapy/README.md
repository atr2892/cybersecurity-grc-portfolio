# Web Recon with Python Scrapy

## Overview
Structured web reconnaissance using Scrapy to collect URLs, forms, and metadata to support threat modeling and application security testing.

## Objective
Generate a site map and enumerated surface of potential attack vectors for prioritizing testing.

## Tools & Methods
- **Tools/Scripts:** Python, Scrapy
- **Techniques:** Targeted crawling and structured output to JSON/CSV

## Approach
- **Problem:** Incomplete discovery leads to missed test cases.
- **Action:** Built spiders to harvest URLs and parameters; stored structured results for review.
- **Result:** Site map and candidate entry points for further testing.

## GRC Relevance
- Supports application risk assessments and secure development lifecycle evidence.

## Artifacts
- 📁 **src/** — spiders
- 📁 **evidence/** — sample crawl outputs
- 📁 **docs/** — scope and run instructions
