# Nmap Recon & Automation

## Overview
Automated network discovery and service enumeration with repeatable reporting to feed asset inventories and vulnerability workflows.

## Objective
Produce a repeatable scanning workflow that identifies hosts, open ports, and service versions and outputs normalized reports for ingestion into vulnerability/risk processes.

## Tools & Methods
- **Tools/Scripts:** Nmap (SYN, svc/version, OS), Bash automation scripts, CSV/HTML export
- **Techniques:** Scheduled scans, throttled timing, result normalization

## Approach
- **Problem:** Manual, ad-hoc scans lead to inconsistent asset data and missed exposures.
- **Action:** Built a Bash wrapper to run Nmap profiles, parse XML output, and generate CSV/HTML reports. Tuned scan timing to minimize disruption and reduce false positives.
- **Result:** Reusable scan profiles and automation scripts; clean asset/service lists ready for risk prioritization and vulnerability scanning.

## GRC Relevance
- Supports **NIST CSF Identify** (asset inventory) and aids evidence collection for change control and vulnerability management.
- Provides auditable scan logs that feed risk registers and compliance checks.
