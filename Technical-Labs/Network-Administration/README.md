# Network Administration Lab

## Overview
Explores network configuration, administration, and security controls in a lab environment.

## Objective
Configure and test fundamental network services with a focus on secure administration practices.

## Tools & Methods
- **Tools/Scripts:** ifconfig/ip, iptables, Bash
- **Techniques:** Service configuration, firewall tuning, monitoring

## Approach
- **Problem:** Misconfigured networks increase exposure to attacks.
- **Action:** Hardened basic services, enforced firewall rules, and validated connectivity restrictions.
- **Result:** Baseline secure network configuration and documented controls.

## GRC Relevance
- Aligns with **NIST CSF PR.AC/PR.PT** and provides artifacts for network control audits.

## Artifacts
- 📁 **src/** — config files and scripts
- 📁 **evidence/** — screenshots of settings and tests
- 📁 **docs/** — hardening checklist
