#### 🌐 Network Security Architecture & Vulnerability Mitigation  
*Type: Network Security Assessment & Redesign Proposal*

**Technologies / Concepts Referenced:**  
OSI Model • TCP/IP • VLANs • Firewalls • Zenmap • OpenVAS • HIPAA Compliance

**Summary:**  
This paper evaluates an outdated and insecure network environment, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes a merged and modernized network architecture with improved performance, segmentation, and regulatory compliance.

---

### 🧩 Problem Overview
The organization operates on an outdated, unsecure network lacking proper segmentation, scalability, and protections. Security threats are compounded by aging hardware, poor configuration, and insufficient monitoring.

---

### 🔍 Security Gaps Identified
Key weaknesses highlighted include:
- Lack of network segmentation  
- Vulnerable or outdated workstations and servers  
- Insufficient access control and policy enforcement  
- Absence of IDS/IPS monitoring  
- Non-compliance with HIPAA requirements

This creates risks of lateral movement, data exposure, and regulatory violations.

---

### 🛠 Assessment Tools Mentioned
The paper references:
- **Zenmap:** GUI-based network scanning for host visibility and port enumeration  
- **OpenVAS:** Vulnerability assessment for services, systems, and remediation prioritization  

These tools help identify misconfigurations and exploitable services.

---

### 🔁 Proposed Network Redesign
A modernized, merged network is proposed to:
- Reduce attack surface  
- Improve traffic management  
- Support monitoring and policy enforcement  
- Meet compliance standards  
- Streamline troubleshooting and security oversight

The redesign leverages segmentation, updated devices, and structured addressing.

---

### 📡 OSI & TCP/IP Model Relevance
The paper reinforces how the OSI and TCP/IP models guide:
- Traffic flow control  
- Secure communication between network layers  
- Hardware/software responsibilities  
- Protocol-based defense strategies

Understanding these models supports effective architecture planning and mitigation.

---

### ⚙️ Upgraded Hardware & Software Justification
Recommended upgrades address:
- Performance bottlenecks  
- Unsupported legacy systems  
- Patch coverage and secure defaults  
- Logging and monitoring enhancements

Modern firewalls, switches, and VLAN-capable devices improve both speed and protection.

---

### 🔐 Secure Network Design Principles
Applied security concepts include:
- Defense-in-depth  
- Least privilege  
- Network segmentation  
- Access control policies  
- Encrypted communications  
- Auditing and monitoring

These principles align with industry standards and healthcare requirements.

---

### ⚖️ Regulatory Compliance (HIPAA)
The network proposal ensures compliance by:
- Protecting PHI through segmentation and encryption  
- Enforcing role-based access and authentication  
- Limiting unnecessary data exposure  
- Establishing audit trails and recovery capabilities

This reduces legal and operational liability for healthcare entities.

---

### 🧭 Threats & Mitigation Strategy
Common threats addressed:
- Unauthorized access → Access control lists, VLANs, and authentication  
- Malware propagation → Segmentation and endpoint hardening  
- Data interception → Encrypted communication and secure tunneling  
- Configuration weaknesses → Vulnerability scanning and patch management

---

### ✅ Key Takeaway
Upgrading and redesigning the network using segmentation, modern devices, and compliance-aligned policies reduces vulnerabilities, improves scalability, and ensures alignment with HIPAA and security best practices.
