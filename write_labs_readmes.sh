# ðŸ”’ Technical Labs â€” Control Validation, Risk Analysis & Security Automation

These labs demonstrate my ability to **identify risks**, **validate/enforce controls**, and **automate remediation** in alignment with GRC frameworks (NIST CSF, CIS Controls, ISO 27001). Each lab includes scripts, evidence, and concise documentation designed for quick recruiter review.

## How to Navigate
Each folder contains:
- `src/` â€“ scripts, configs, or artifacts (pcap, bash, ps1, py)
- `evidence/` â€“ redacted screenshots or outputs proving the result
- `docs/` â€“ short write-ups or summaries connecting work to risk/control value

## Lab Index (with one-line impact)
- **Active Directory Enumeration** â€” Implements access discovery to identify privilege exposure and support IAM risk reduction.  
  `Technical-Labs/Active-Directory-Enumeration/`
- **DNS Blocking Automation** â€” Automates malicious domain blocking to prevent callbacks and reduce threat exposure.  
  `Technical-Labs/DNS-Blocking-Automation/`
- **Firewall Rule Automation** â€” Transforms threat intel into enforced network controls to harden perimeter defenses.  
  `Technical-Labs/Firewall-Rule-Automation/`
- **Malware Removal Automation** â€” Uses automated detection and cleanup to limit malware persistence and reduce dwell time.  
  `Technical-Labs/Malware-Removal-Automation/`
