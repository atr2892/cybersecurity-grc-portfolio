# Incident Response & Runbooks

**Purpose (GRC):** Standardize triage → containment → eradication → recovery with **audit-ready evidence** (NIST CSF RS/RC).

## What this includes
- **Phishing/AitM** evidence from packet analysis (credentials seen in transit)
- **Malware cleanup** automation and verification screenshots
- Pointers to runnable scripts and filters

## Work represented (links to labs)
- AitM/credential capture: `Technical-Labs/Wireshark-Sniffing-Network-Traffic/`
- Malware removal automation & proof: `Technical-Labs/Malware-Removal-Automation/`

## Runbooks to build from this
- Phishing/AitM triage (proxy settings, packet capture, credential reset)
- Malware response (hash-based hunt, removal, scheduling, logs)
- Reporting: artifacts, chain-of-custody notes, ticket linkage
