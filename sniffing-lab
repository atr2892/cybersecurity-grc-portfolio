# Live Lab: Sniffing Network Traffic

**Prepared by:** Alison T. Richardson‑Howard
**Purpose:** Hands-on student lab demonstrating how to capture network traffic with `tcpdump`, analyze `.pcap` files with Wireshark, and document findings for security assessment and reporting.
**Context:** Suitable for inclusion in a cybersecurity portfolio as a redacted lab demonstration. Raw `.pcap` files and unredacted screenshots are intentionally excluded for privacy and safety.

## Highlights
- Demonstrates practical use of `tcpdump` for ICMP, HTTP (port 80), and FTP capture workflows.
- Shows how to analyze HTTP POST credentials (redacted) in Wireshark and identify weak/unencrypted protocols.
- Includes a sanitized lab report template and redacted evidence images for public sharing.

## Quick start
```bash
unzip sniffing_lab_repo.zip -d sniffing_lab_repo
cd sniffing_lab_repo

# Inspect lab and report
less lab/README.md
less report/lab_report.md

# Convert markdown to PDF locally (optional)
pandoc report/lab_report.md -o report/lab_report.pdf

# Push to your GitHub
./push_to_github.sh git@github.com:<youruser>/sniffing-lab.git
```

## Notes on publication
- Do **not** publish raw `.pcap` captures publicly. Store them in a private evidence store if needed for instructor review.
- Prior to public release, replace any identifying metadata with placeholders and confirm screenshots are redacted.
