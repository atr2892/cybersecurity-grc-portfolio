# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) Portfolio  
**by Alison Richardson**

This portfolio highlights my work in cybersecurity through the lens of **governance, risk management, compliance, security controls, vulnerability analysis, and incident documentation**. My background in technical operations and engineering allows me to connect real-world processes with security requirements, policy enforcement, and risk reduction.

## üîπ Featured GRC-Focused Projects

### ‚úÖ 1. Splunk Detection & Security Controls
Use cases focused on:
- SIEM analysis and monitoring
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Alert creation and rule tuning
- Incident documentation and response planning
- Alignment with NIST CSF ‚ÄúDetect‚Äù functions

**Folder:** `/GRC-Projects/Splunk-Detection-and-Controls`

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Vulnerability Risk Assessment & Remediation
Projects that simulate:
- Vulnerability scanning (Nessus/OpenVAS examples)
- CVSS scoring and prioritization
- Remediation planning
- Reporting for leadership or audit teams
- Risk tracking and follow-up documentation

**Folder:** `/GRC-Projects/Vulnerability-Risk-Assessment`

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Incident Response & Runbooks
Focused on:
- Response workflows
- Lateral movement scenarios
- Cleanup and containment steps
- Post-incident documentation
- Role-based escalation

**Folder:** `/GRC-Projects/Incident-Response-and-Runbooks`

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Policy & Compliance Artifacts
Demonstrations of:
- Access control standards
- Acceptable use policies
- Vendor or third-party risk frameworks
- Alignment with ISO 27001 / NIST / PCI
- Audit readiness documentation

**Folder:** `/GRC-Projects/Policy-and-Compliance-Documents`

---

## üîπ Technical Labs (Supporting Hands-On Work)

These labs reinforce the technical understanding behind controls and risk decisions:

**Folder:** `/Technical-Labs`

Examples include:
- TryHackMe labs
- Linux & Windows hardening
- Wireshark packet analysis
- Metasploit simulations
- Network and host recon exercises

---

## üîπ Reporting, Risk & Remediation

Communication and documentation are essential in GRC. These files demonstrate:
- Executive summaries
- Risk register examples
- Remediation plans
- Stakeholder communication deliverables

**Folder:** `/Reporting-and-Remediation`
