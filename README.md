## Projects

### üîπ Pentesting Work

#### üè• Penetration Testing Engagement Plan Evaluation ‚Äì Western View Hospital  
*Type: Engagement Analysis & Strategic Recommendations*

This project evaluates a penetration testing engagement plan for a healthcare organization and analyzes how well it aligns with compliance requirements, operational needs, and industry standards.

**Focus Areas:**  
- Penetration Testing Methodology  
- Risk & Impact Evaluation  
- HIPAA, GDPR, PCI DSS Alignment  
- NIST SP 800-115 & ISO 27001 Integration  
- Reporting & Remediation Strategy

**Key Contributions:**  
- Assessed scope across internal, external, and social engineering vectors  
- Identified gaps in:
  - Encryption validation  
  - Incident response planning  
  - Backup and disaster recovery  
- Recommended:
  - Clear Rules of Engagement  
  - CVSS 3.1-based severity scoring  
  - Phishing awareness controls  
  - Contingency and rollback procedures

**Tools Referenced:**  
Nmap ‚Ä¢ Burp Suite ‚Ä¢ Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) ‚Ä¢ Vulnerability Scanning ‚Ä¢ Enumeration ‚Ä¢ Exploitation ‚Ä¢ Credential Harvesting

**Outcome:**  
Enhanced compliance coverage, minimized risk of service disruption, and improved reporting clarity for both executive and technical stakeholders.

1) Network Traffic Capture & Analysis  
Tools: tcpdump, Wireshark  
Steps: capture HTTP/FTP/ICMP, load PCAPs in Wireshark, verify plaintext POST creds.  
Takeaway: insecure protocols leak credentials; capture + analysis confirms risk.

2) Nmap Scripting & Automation  
Tools: Bash, Nmap  
Steps: wrote NmapAnalysis.sh; fixed -F conflict; added prompts & dual-port logic.  
Takeaway: fast recon with reliable, prompt-driven scanning.

3) Active Directory Enumeration  
Tools: PowerShell  
Steps: enumerated domain computers, users, groups, user details.  
Takeaway: AD recon quickly outlines attack surface & access patterns.

4) DNS Blocking Automation  
Tools: Bash  
Steps: pull bad domains, update /etc/hosts, verify resolution blocked.  
Takeaway: quick DNS sinkhole stops callbacks/phishing domains.

5) Firewall Rule Automation  
Tools: Bash, iptables, cron  
Steps: ingest CIDR threat feed, add DROP rules, de-dup, schedule with cron.  
Takeaway: automated network hardening with scheduled updates.

Completed Config For Iptables By Scripting Automated Scheduling Script Will Update Iptables Filter Rules With Ip Ranges From Threat Intelligence Feed Drop Rules Added To Ip Address Table Automate Script To Block Malicious Ip Addresses Automation Of Ip Range Firewall Block Rules From A Threat Feed List Of Ip Address That Were Used By Attackers Set Firewall Block Rules And Set Remove Duplicates (no screenshots found)

6) Malware Removal Automation  
Tools: Bash, threat hash feed, cron  
Steps: match filenames+hashes, remove malware binaries, schedule cleanup.  
Takeaway: hash-based removal reduces dwell time for known threats.

7) SQL Injection Enumeration (SQLMap)  
Tools: SQLMap  
Steps: detect DBMS, list tables, enumerate columns/records.  
Takeaway: shows full DB exposure from SQLi in vulnerable app.

8) Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM)  
Tools: Burp Suite (proxy), Kali (attacker), Windows (victim)  
Steps: proxy script changed victim settings; intercepted login POST to Juice Shop.  
Takeaway: on-path interception + social engineering exposes credentials.

9) Directory Traversal  
Tools: Browser, Burp (optional)  
Steps: manipulate URL to access files (e.g., /etc/passwd), confirm data disclosure.  
Takeaway: improper path handling leads to sensitive file exposure.

10) Scripting & Recon Automation  
Tools: Bash, Python (Scapy/Scrapy), PowerShell  
Steps: built DNS recon, AD search, and Nmap automation; validated outputs and fixed errors.  
Takeaway: automation accelerates triage, recon, and defensive response.
