# 🔐 Cybersecurity Portfolio – Alison T. Richardson-Howard

Welcome to my professional cybersecurity portfolio.  
This repository showcases hands-on labs, research projects, and case studies I’ve completed in penetration testing, cloud security, incident response, and secure architecture.  

🚀 My goal: Transition into a cybersecurity engineer/auditor role while applying my engineering background to secure real-world systems.

## 👩‍💻 About Me
I’m a cybersecurity professional in transition with an M.S. in **Cybersecurity & Information Assurance** (in progress, WGU – Winter 2025).  
My background in **engineering, operations, and robotics** gives me a unique perspective in applying structured methodologies to cybersecurity.  

I enjoy bridging **cloud security, red teaming, and secure architecture**, while documenting projects so others can learn.
