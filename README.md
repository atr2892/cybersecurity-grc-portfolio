## Projects

### üîπ Pentesting Work

#### üè• Penetration Testing Engagement Plan Evaluation ‚Äì Western View Hospital  
*Type: Engagement Analysis & Strategic Recommendations*

**Tools Used:**  
Nmap ‚Ä¢ Burp Suite ‚Ä¢ Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) ‚Ä¢ Vulnerability Scanning

**Summary:**  
Evaluated a penetration testing engagement plan for a healthcare organization, assessing alignment with operational continuity, compliance requirements, and industry best practices.

**Steps Performed:**  
- Reviewed scope for internal, external, and social engineering tests  
- Mapped plan elements to HIPAA, NIST SP 800-115, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and GDPR controls  
- Evaluated reporting, remediation scoring, and Rules of Engagement for safety and uptime concerns

**Key Takeaway:**  
Actionable recommendations provided to reduce disruption risk, improve compliance coverage, and clarify reporting for both technical and executive stakeholders. *(Redacted document available; unredacted on request with appropriate approvals.)*

#### üõ∞Ô∏è 1) Network Traffic Capture & Analysis  
*Type: Network Forensics Lab*

**Tools Used:**  
tcpdump ‚Ä¢ Wireshark

**Summary:**  
Captured and analyzed HTTP, FTP, and ICMP traffic to demonstrate how plaintext credentials and sensitive information can be exposed on insecure protocols.

**Steps Performed:**  
- Captured packets with `tcpdump` for HTTP (port 80), FTP, and ICMP traffic  
- Loaded PCAPs into Wireshark for protocol analysis and packet inspection  
- Located and examined HTTP POST requests to identify plaintext credentials

**Key Takeaway:**  
Unencrypted protocols leak credentials in transit ‚Äî enforce TLS and deprecate insecure services to mitigate credential exposure.

#### üîç 2) Nmap Scripting & Automation  
*Type: Recon Automation Lab*

**Tools Used:**  
Bash ‚Ä¢ Nmap

**Summary:**  
Developed and debugged an Nmap automation script (`NmapAnalysis.sh`) to streamline recon and handle dual-port scanning and user prompts.

**Steps Performed:**  
- Wrote `NmapAnalysis.sh` with interactive prompts for target and port selection  
- Resolved a `-F` conflict and other script errors to improve reliability  
- Added logic to handle targets with multiple open ports and produced consistent output

**Key Takeaway:**  
Automation speeds reconnaissance while reducing manual errors; robust scripts should handle edge cases and provide clear prompts for repeatable scans.

#### üß© 3) Active Directory Enumeration  
*Type: AD Recon Lab*

**Tools Used:**  
PowerShell

**Summary:**  
Performed Active Directory enumeration to identify domain computers, users, groups, and account details ‚Äî mapping potential attack surface and privilege relationships.

**Steps Performed:**  
- Queried domain for computer and server listings  
- Enumerated user accounts and group memberships using PowerShell  
- Collected user metadata useful for privilege escalation and lateral-movement analysis

**Key Takeaway:**  
AD enumeration quickly surfaces visibility into access patterns and high-value targets; inventory and least-privilege controls reduce exposure.

---

#### üõë 4) DNS Blocking Automation  
*Type: Defensive Automation Lab*

**Tools Used:**  
Bash

**Summary:**  
Implemented an automated DNS sinkhole process that retrieves malicious domain feeds and blocks resolution by updating `/etc/hosts`.

**Steps Performed:**  
- Pulled threat feed of malicious domains programmatically  
- Updated `/etc/hosts` to redirect/block listed domains  
- Verified blocked resolution via DNS lookups and resolution checks

**Key Takeaway:**  
A simple DNS sinkhole provides fast mitigation for known-malicious domains, reducing callbacks and limiting user exposure to phishing/malware C2.

---

#### üî• 5) Firewall Rule Automation  
*Type: Network Hardening Automation*

**Tools Used:**  
Bash ‚Ä¢ iptables ‚Ä¢ cron

**Summary:**  
Automated ingestion of CIDR threat feeds to add DROP rules to `iptables`, with duplicate removal and scheduled updates.

**Steps Performed:**  
- Ingested CIDR lists from threat feeds and normalized IP ranges  
- Programmatically updated `iptables` with DROP rules, ensuring de-duplication  
- Scheduled regular updates through `cron` to maintain current protections

**Key Takeaway:**  
Automated firewall updates from trusted threat feeds enable continuous network hardening and reduce manual maintenance overhead.

---

#### üßπ 6) Malware Removal Automation  
*Type: Endpoint Remediation Automation*

**Tools Used:**  
Bash ‚Ä¢ threat hash feed ‚Ä¢ cron

**Summary:**  
Built an automated cleanup script that matches file names and known-malware hashes to remove binaries and scheduled periodic scans/cleanup.

**Steps Performed:**  
- Matched local files against a threat-hash feed  
- Removed files identified as malicious and logged actions  
- Scheduled cleanup via `cron` to regularly sweep for known threats

**Key Takeaway:**  
Hash-based removal reduces dwell time for known malware; combine with behavioral detection for broader coverage against unknown threats.

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è 7) SQL Injection Enumeration (SQLMap)  
*Type: Web App Vulnerability Lab*

**Tools Used:**  
SQLMap

**Summary:**  
Used SQLMap to detect and exploit SQL injection in a vulnerable application, enumerating database, tables, and columns to demonstrate data exposure.

**Steps Performed:**  
- Ran SQLMap to fingerprint the DBMS and identify injectable parameters  
- Enumerated available databases, tables, and columns  
- Extracted example records to demonstrate impact of SQLi vulnerabilities

**Key Takeaway:**  
SQL injection can yield full database exposure; parameterized queries and input validation are critical defenses.

#### üéØ 8) Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM)  
*Type: Web Proxy / On-Path Attack Lab*

**Tools Used:**  
Burp Suite ‚Ä¢ Kali Linux ‚Ä¢ Windows (victim)

**Summary:**  
Performed an on-path interception exercise against OWASP Juice Shop (proxying victim traffic) to capture login POSTs and demonstrate credential theft via AitM techniques.

**Steps Performed:**  
- Configured Burp Suite as an intercepting proxy and adjusted victim browser settings  
- Intercepted and analyzed HTTP POST requests containing credentials  
- Documented the workflow and artifacts demonstrating successful interception

**Key Takeaway:**  
On-path interception combine
