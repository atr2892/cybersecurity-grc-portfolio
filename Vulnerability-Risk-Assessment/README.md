# Vulnerability & Risk Assessment

**Purpose (GRC):** Turn technical findings into **prioritized risk** with owners, due dates, and closure evidence.

## Findings represented here
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** DB discovery & table/column enumeration (proof-of-impact)
- **Directory Traversal:** Sensitive file access via path manipulation

## How I handle it
- Translate to risk register entries (CVSS + business impact)
- Create remediation tickets with owners & SLA
- Capture **before/after** proof in `evidence/`
