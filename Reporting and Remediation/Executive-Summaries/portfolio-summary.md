# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity GRC Portfolio  
**by Alison Richardson**

I build security programs that connect technical controls with risk-aware processes and clear, audit-ready documentation. This portfolio demonstrates practical work across Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) ‚Äî backed by hands-on technical labs that show how controls are implemented and validated.

---

## üîπ What I focus on
- Security governance and policy alignment (NIST CSF, ISO 27001, PCI)  
- Vulnerability assessment, risk scoring, and remediation planning  
- SIEM-based detection, incident documentation, and runbook creation  
- Process-driven security controls and automation to reduce operational risk  
- Clear executive reporting and remediation tracking for audits

## üîπ Featured GRC Projects (high-level)
1. **Splunk Detection & Controls** ‚Äî SIEM detection, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, alerts & triage.  
   _Folder:_ `/GRC-Projects/Splunk-Detection-and-Controls`

2. **Vulnerability Risk Assessment** ‚Äî scan ingestion, CVSS prioritization, remediation plan.  
   _Folder:_ `/GRC-Projects/Vulnerability-Risk-Assessment`

3. **Incident Response & Runbooks** ‚Äî containment, escalation, cleanup, and post-incident reporting.  
   _Folder:_ `/GRC-Projects/Incident-Response-and-Runbooks`

4. **Policy & Compliance Artifacts** ‚Äî access control standards, vendor risk templates, audit checklists.  
   _Folder:_ `/GRC-Projects/Policy-and-Compliance-Documents`

## üîπ Supporting Technical Labs (evidence & hands-on)
Technical labs support the control decisions above. They live in `/Technical-Labs` and include work on networking, cloud, automation, and exploitation techniques used to validate controls.

Example labs:
- Network traffic capture & analysis (tcpdump / Wireshark)  
- Nmap automation & scripted scans  
- AD enumeration & asset discovery  
- Firewall automation and host hardening scripts  
- SQLi, AitM, directory traversal demos (sandboxed/controlled)

_Folder:_ `/Technical-Labs`

---

## üîπ Reporting & Remediation (templates)
Includes executive summaries, remediation plans, and risk registers you can reuse for audits and stakeholder reporting.

_Folder:_ `/Reporting-and-Remediation`

---

## üîπ How to use this repo
1. Browse `/GRC-Projects` first for high-level, recruiter-friendly deliverables.  
2. Open `/Reporting-and-Remediation` for templated executive artifacts.  
3. Explore `/Technical-Labs` if you want the raw evidence (screenshots, scripts, SPL queries).
