# Lab Report Template â€” Sniffing Network Traffic

**Student:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Capture Summary
- Interface used: eth0
- Commands run:
  - sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -c 100
  - sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -c 100 -nn
  - sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -c 100 icmp
  - sudo tcpdump -i eth0 port 80 -w juiceshop-web.pcap
  - sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w PC-ftp.pcap

## Findings
- ICMP echo request/reply observed during ping test.
- Plaintext HTTP POST to `/rest/user/login` observed (credentials redacted in public artifacts).
- FTP file transfer observed between PC and Kali (pcap saved as PC-ftp.pcap).

## Evidence (redacted)
See `screenshots/` for redacted screenshots. Raw `.pcap` files are stored in private evidence repository.

## Recommendations
1. Disable plaintext FTP; use SFTP/FTPS.
2. Enforce HTTPS and HSTS; never transmit credentials over HTTP.
3. Implement network monitoring and segment critical services.
