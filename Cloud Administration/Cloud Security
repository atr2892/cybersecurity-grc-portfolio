#### ☁️ Cloud Security Assessment & Architecture Proposal  
*Type: Cloud Security Analysis & Implementation Plan*

**Technologies / Platforms Referenced:**  
Azure Key Vault • RBAC • Virtual Machines • Cloud Backup Solutions • IaaS Security Models

**Summary:**  
This paper analyzes on-premise security gaps and proposes a secure cloud architecture to improve confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It emphasizes proper RBAC implementation, key management, backup strategy, and shared responsibility in IaaS environments.

### 🧩 Scenario Overview
A company faces increasing operational and security challenges with its existing on-premise environment. A cloud solution is proposed to address its need for scalability, protection of sensitive data, and access control improvements.

---

### 🔐 Security Gaps Identified
- Poor role-based access control enforcement
- Inadequate key management practices
- Unclear responsibility split for infrastructure security
- Limited backup and recovery mechanisms

These weaknesses increase the risk of data breaches, insider misuse, and system downtime.

---

### ☁️ Cloud Solution Proposal
The proposed architecture migrates core infrastructure to the cloud using:
- **Azure Key Vault** for secret, key, and certificate management
- **RBAC** to enforce least privilege and task separation
- **IaaS framework** to define shared responsibilities between customer and provider
- **Cloud-based backup and restoration** to ensure continuity

This solution enhances security visibility, automates access control, and improves policy enforcement.

---

### 🧑‍💼 RBAC Structure & Justification
The paper emphasizes:
- Assigning users only the permissions required for their role
- Segregating high-impact privileges
- Using role assignments within Azure AD
- Mapping responsibilities to operational duties (e.g., admin vs. standard user)

This reduces internal threat exposure and audit failures.

---

### 🔑 Azure Key Vault Configuration
Key Vault is recommended for:
- Storing secrets, keys, and certificates securely
- Enforcing access via RBAC or access policies
- Automating key rotation
- Integrating with services hosted in Azure

This prevents credential leakage and centralizes key lifecycle management.

---

### 🔄 Cloud Backup Strategy
The cloud backup approach covers:
- Regular snapshots of virtual machines
- Encrypted offsite backup storage
- Restoration testing to ensure functionality
- Defined Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

This enhances business continuity compared to legacy systems.

---

### 🏗 IaaS Responsibility Breakdown
The paper clarifies who is responsible for:
**Cloud provider:**  
- Physical infrastructure  
- Hypervisors  
- Core networking  
- Datacenter security

**Customer:**  
- Operating system configuration  
- Identity and access management  
- Data classification and encryption  
- Security updates and compliance

This reduces confusion and strengthens compliance alignment.

---

### ⚠️ Threats & Mitigations
Common threats addressed:
- **Unauthorized access** → Enforced RBAC, MFA, and access logs  
- **Data exfiltration** → Encryption at rest and in transit  
- **Key exposure** → Managed storage in Azure Key Vault  
- **System failure** → Cloud-based backups and redundancy

These mitigations align with defense-in-depth and zero-trust principles.

---

### ✅ Key Takeaway
Migrating to a cloud environment with structured RBAC, secure key management, clear IaaS responsibilities, and automated backups significantly improves organizational security posture while reducing operational risk.
