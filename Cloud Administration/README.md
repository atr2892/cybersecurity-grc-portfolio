# Cloud Administration

**Purpose (GRC):** Baseline **secure configuration** (identity, network, logging, storage) with verification and logging.

## Current status
This repo currently focuses on on-prem/lab artifacts. This page is ready to host:
- IAM baseline (MFA, role-based access, key rotation)
- Network guardrails (least-priv SGs/NACLs, egress control)
- Logging/monitoring (centralized logs, alerts)
- Storage policies (encryption, lifecycle)

> Add screenshots/CLI outputs under `evidence/` and short steps under `docs/` as you capture them.
